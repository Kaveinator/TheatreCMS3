        In 1997, Theatre Vertigo was founded by Paul Floding, Nanette Pettit and Jeff Meyers.  Since then, Theatre Vertigo has performed in numerous spaces including The Russell Street Theater, The Electric Company, Theater!Theatre!, and The Shoebox Theater.

        From 2003 to 2014, Theatre Vertigo produced Anonymous Theatre as a summer fundraiser in collaboration with The Anonymous Theatre Company.  Other past collaborations include defunkt theatre, Stark Raving Theater, and Tears of Joy Theatre.

        Theatre Vertigo has worked on world premieres including Faust.Us by Joseph Fisher, 99 Ways to Fuck a Swan by Kim Rosenstock, and The End of Sex by Craig Jessen.
